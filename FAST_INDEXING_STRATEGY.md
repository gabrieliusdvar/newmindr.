# Accelerated Google Indexing Strategy for newmindr.

To get "newmindr.", "naujos mintys", and "naujos smegenys" ranking as fast as possible (potentially within 24-48 hours), you must combine the code changes I just made with these manual actions.

## 1. The "Fast Track" (Do This IMMEDIATELY)

### Google Search Console (GSC) - The Most Critical Step
**If you haven't done this, Google is just guessing.**
1.  Go to **[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)**.
2.  If you haven't verified your domain yet, do it now (via DNS or uploading a file).
3.  **Submit your Sitemap**:
    *   Go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu.
    *   Enter `sitemap.xml` and click **Submit**.
4.  **Force Re-indexing**:
    *   Paste `https://www.newmindr.com/` into the top search bar ("Inspect any URL").
    *   Click **"Request Indexing"**.
    *   **Repeat this** for your key pages:
        *   `https://www.newmindr.com/?lang=lt` (Crucial for "naujos mintys")
        *   `https://www.newmindr.com/courses`
        *   `https://www.newmindr.com/blog`

## 2. Social Signal Blast (The "Wake Up Google" Method)
Google watches traffic. If people suddenly start clicking your link from trusted sites, Google notices.
*   **Post on Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter TODAY**:
    *   "🚀 newmindr. is officially live with a new look! Check out the future of interactive learning: https://www.newmindr.com"
    *   **Crucial**: Ask 5-10 friends to **click the link**, spend 1 minute on the site, and click around. This "User Engagement" signals to Google that the site is valuable.

## 3. How to Get Sitelinks (The "Digiklasė" Sections)
These sections ("Courses", "About", etc.) are **automated** by Google. You cannot "buy" them, but I have just added the **code** to make them highly likely to appear:

1.  **Code Check**: I added `SiteNavigationElement` Schema to your `index.html`. This explicitly tells Google "These are my main sections."
2.  **Clear Navigation**: Ensure your footer and header links exactly match these main pages. I checked your code, and the structure is good.
3.  **Time**: Once you see your site ranking #1 for "newmindr", the sitelinks usually appear 3-7 days later as traffic grows.

## 4. The "Naujos Mintys" / "Naujos Smegenys" Strategy
I have added these exact keywords to your Lithuanian metadata.
*   **To rank faster**: Use these phrases in a real sentence on your **Facebook page** or **Instagram bio**.
    *   Example Bio: "newmindr. - Naujos mintys, naujos smegenys, naujas mokymosi būdas."
    *   Linking these words to your site from social media creates a strong relevance signal.
